# 3. Hello World

To use TotalCross you will need to have [Visual Studio Code installed](../miscelaneous/installing-visual-studio-code.md) on your machine, as well as [Java 8](../miscelaneous/java-8.md) and [Maven](../miscelaneous/maven.md). 

Once these dependencies are sorted, you can [install TotalCross](install.md) in two easy steps and [create your free account](register.md) in three more steps.

Continue following this **Get Started** Guide and you will create [your first TotalCross App](hello-world.md) in 5 steps.

Shall we begin?

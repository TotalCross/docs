# Getting started

We've prepared a simple way for you to create your own apps and deliver to any platform, using only **Java** and **TotalCross** \(no iOS or Android knowledge required\)!

## **Basic Requirements**

To create apps with TotalCross, you just need to:

* get a[ TotalCross key](https://learn.totalcross.com/learn-totalcross/requirements/totalcross-key)
* have [Java JDK 8](https://learn.totalcross.com/learn-totalcross/requirements/java-8) installed;
* have[ Maven](https://app.gitbook.com/@totalcross/s/playbook/~/drafts/-LckZfuWjUhttQtTbzGx/primary/learn-totalcross/getting-started/basic-requirements/maven) installed;
* [your favorite IDE](https://learn.totalcross.com/learn-totalcross/getting-started/first-totalcross-app);

## VS Code

We recommend the plug in VS Code as it is light and complete for your project, with it you create, run and deploy!

**Installing VsCode**

**Linux**

The easiest way to install Visual Studio Code for Debian / Ubuntu based distributions is to install the .deb package, via the graphics software center, if available on your Linux distribution, or download from [https://code.visualstudio.com/Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) the .deb file and install it with the following command in the terminal: `sudo apt install ./<file>.deb`

Or through the command line with: `sudo apt-get install code`

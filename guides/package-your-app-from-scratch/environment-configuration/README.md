# Environment Variables in IDE

As you may have seen in the [Deploy session](https://totalcross.gitbook.io/playbook/learn-totalcross/deploy-your-app-android-ios-and-windows), in the basic requirements part, you need the TotalCross SDK to generate your application \(apk, ipa, exe and etc\).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Remember**: This happens because at the time of generating your application for the desired platform it is necessary to pass all your code through our virtual machine \(TCVM\).
{% endhint %}

To point to the SDK, you can either configure this environment variable in the operating system itself or it can point directly to the IDE \(depending on which one you are using\).

Because it is much easier to configure the SDK directly in the IDE we chose to create a step-by-step guide on how to configure your IDE at the time of deployment and point to the TotalCross SDK.

### IDEs

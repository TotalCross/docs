# OpenGL

## Overview

TotalCross uses technology used in games to create interfaces: an OpenGL. It is a blockbuster, such as the famous [Counter Strike](https://blog.counter-strike.net/).

## Which is?

OpenGL - Open Graphics Libray - is an API \(Application Programming Interface\) used in computer graphics to develop graphic applications, games, 3D environments and others.

**As iOS will depreciate OpenGL**, that is, it will still work but not in the correct way and will not be supported, **TotalCross decided to implement Skia**, another technology still more current to work the graphic components.

TotalCross uses Skia since version 6.0.0.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To start using TotalCross, you will need to install this dependencies on your machine:

* [Java 8](../miscelaneous/java-8.md) 
* [Maven](../miscelaneous/maven.md)

## Visual Studio Code Plugin

You can create your TotalCross applications from any IDE of your choice, but we highly recommend starting out with [Visual Studio Code](../miscelaneous/installing-visual-studio-code.md), using the official [TotalCross VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=totalcross.vscode-totalcross), as it is a very quick and easy process. In the next steps of this getting started we will guide you on how to install the plugin and run your first application. 

## Running from other IDEs

If you prefer to build TotalCross from scratch and run it on your favorite IDE, you can clone our [HelloWorld](https://github.com/TotalCross/HelloWorld) repository and run the following command: 

```text
$ mvn package
```

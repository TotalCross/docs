# Maps

TotalCross currently does not have support for applications that need a dynamic map, but it is still possible to work with static map. In addition, we are working to integrate a new and improved navigation API in TotalCross.



The static map is an image captured by a request in an API that shows the map of the requested parameters.

{% page-ref page="static-map.md" %}

Old API using google Map currently deprecated.

{% page-ref page="maps.md" %}
